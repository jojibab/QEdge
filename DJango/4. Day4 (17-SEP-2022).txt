==>>> Django Framework Software Installation::-

==> Pre-Requisites:-
(Mininum System Requirements)
a) Python software (3.0 or Later)
b) Windows OS 7 or Later (8,8.1,10,11...etc)


=> How to install DJango:-
(STEPS)
1) Make sure Python is already installed in our system 
Ex:- (Type the command in prompt)
(start--->type(cmd)---->select "Command-Prompt-App"
(Windows-Command-Prompt is opened)
	cmd> python --version 
	cmd> py --version 
	
=**Optionally verify your windows-OS version
(Rt.click on  This-PC(My-PC) ----> Select-Properties ----> Verify "Windows-Edition"
(Windows 10 Home/Professional/Enterprise)

2) Install django by using pip (command)
(DJango will be downloaded directly from Python-Server-Repository & it will be installed or integrated with Python Software in our system)
[**pip --->Python Installer for packages]
Ex:-
	cmd> pip install django 
	(pip install django x.x.x version)

cmd>pip install django  (ENTER)
(latest-version is Django-4.1.1)
(internet conn is compulsory)
(django-framework is installed as module(lib) in python-software)

3) Checking & Verifying DJango version,
Ex:-
cmd> py -m django --version 
cmd> python -m django --version 
(or)
>>>(in py-interactive-mode)
>>>help("modules")




***(Working with First-Project & First-App in DJango)***
-------------------------------------------------------------
=>> Diango Project vs Diango Application:-
------------------------------------------
= A Django project is a collection of diff-Django-applications and  its configurations, this makes up a full-web-application
Ex:- Bank-Project or Google-Project
==Diagram==

Ex:-
= A Django-Application is responsible to perform a particular specific-task in our entire web application
****Bank-Project****
Ex:- Loan-App,
	Registration-App,
	Deposit-App,
	Customer-App,
	Withdraw-App.
	Locker-App,
	CreditCard-App,
	DebitCard-App
	etc 
==Diagram==
[Above-Apps + Configurations ==> Django-Project]


NOTE:-
1) 
= DJango applications reusable apps
i.e, they can be plugged into other projects-easily
(Pluggable Django Applications) 
2) 
= Without DJango project there is no chance of DJango Application
i.e, Before creating any DJango-App, 1st we are required to create DJango-Project
(Compulsory create 1st Django-Project & then 2nd Django-apps)



(****)First-Project in Django
-------------------------------
==>> How to create Django Project:-
= Once we installed django in our system, we have to get 'django-admin' command-line tool, which can be used to create our Django-project

Ex:-
= To work with DJango-Project, we require our working-directory
(F:\SAISIR\DJANGO> is our working-directory)
[cmd> django-admin startproject FirstProject]

Ex:-
F:\SAISIR\DJANGO>django-admin startproject FirstProject 
= The following project structure will be created 
F:\SAISIR\DJANGO>
	+-- FirstProject(proj-folder)
		-> manage.py 
		+-- FirstProject(pkg-Folder)
			-> __init__.py
			-> asgi.py
			-> settings.py 
			-> urls.py 
			-> wsgi.py 
		

==>How to Run DJango Development Server: :-
= Whenever we install DJANGO-Framework in our system, 2-imp. things are installed in our system
(cmd> pip install django)
	i) DJANGO-library (to write programs)
	ii) DJANGO Live-Development-Server 
	(to run our-apps from django-project)
	
= We have to move to the "manage.py" file-location and we have to execute the following command
Ex:-
**[py manage.py runserver]**

------------------------------------------------------------------
F:\SAISIR\DJANGO\FirstProject>py manage.py runserver (preferable)
(or)
F:\SAISIR\DJANGO\FirstProject>py manage.py startserver
------------------------------------------------------------------

(***)
NOTE:-
= After giving this command, our DJANGO Live-Development-Server starts automatically in our system & gives below message
-----------------------------------------
Django version 4.1.1, using settings 'FirstProject.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
-------------------------------------------
*********Above msg indicates DJango-Server is started***********
(Server-Request-URL ::- http://127.0.0.1:8000/)



***(Verifying Django-Server Status)***
==>How to Send First Request:-
= Open browser and send request with above-URL: 
(Type this in Address-Bar)
Ex:-
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/
(Instead of "127.0.0.1", we can also use localhost i.e, current-system-ip)
Ex:-
	http://localhost:8000/

NOTE:-
= We get Django Running Server Homepage, if everything goes fine 
i.e, for successful client-request
