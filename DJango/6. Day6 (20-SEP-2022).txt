*****(Working with FirstApp (DJ-App in DJ-Project)*****
--------------------------------------------------------
==> Activities/Steps required for Application(FirstApp)::- 
= After creating 1st-Django-App(FirstApp), we have configure our DJANGO-App using below steps,

1) Step1:-
= Add our application-name(FirstApp) in "settings.py" file of Project-Folder
Ex:-
"settings.py"  ***WARNING:-Dont do any un-necc-changes to file***
---------------
(F:\SAISIR\DJANGO\FirstProject\FirstProject) [proj-conf-folder]
---------------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
	'FirstApp'
] 
#open settings.py, add 'FirstApp' in the last value of list-var("INSTALLED_APPS")
= In doing so, our Django-project gets aware about our application(FirstApp)
(hence our app is registed with Project)

= Finally, save the file(settings.py)


2) Step2:-
= Create our own-view-function for our application in "views.py" file of our "FirstApp"
= View-func is responsible to prepare required response(reply) to the end-user(client-request)
= Response-data is "html-webpage-page"
=** View also contains business-logic (logics used in our app)
(coding to process data)
Ex:-
	totalmarks=s1+s2+s3+s4+s5
	avgmarks=totalmarks/5
(or)
	atm-trans (finalbal = initialbal-wamt)

=* There are 2-types of views,
	a) Function Based Views  (direct-func)
	b) Class Based Views  (class-method/func)

= As of now, we are using "Function based views"
(here we write python-function Ex:- display(), which accepts client-request, process-request and give client-response(html-webpage)
Ex:-
"views.py" (of FirstApp app-folder)
------------
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse;

# Create your views here.
def display(request): #view-function
	ss = "<center><h2 style='color:Blue;'>Hello User, Welcome to Django First-Project First-App</h2><hr /></center>";
	return HttpResponse(ss);


=**Save the views.py prog


NOTE:-
(Tech-points)
-----------------
= For each view, we have one function in views.py
= Here display() is a function, which is one-view
= Each view(function) take atleast 1-input-parameter(request), its mandatory
= this request-obj is of type HttpRequest-class(type)
(it contains client-request info)
Ex:-
	username,password (for login-page-request)
	(client-ip-addr, client-req-url/page, client-req-time,client-req-browser-name)
= Each view-func returns HttpResponse-obj with required response-data(string with html-webpage-code) to client
Ex:-
	return HttpResponse(ss);
= this response-data(html-data) i.e, "ss" will goto same-client as response & displays in client-browser

=** django.http is as "Django-module" to work with http-request & response
(from this module, we use HttpRequest, HttpResponse 2-classes)

 	
==Diagram==
	Request------->[View]-------->Response
(View can accept client-request as input, and performs required operations & provides proper response to End-user(client))

Step3:- (urls.py) ---> proj-conf-folder
= Now, define URL-pattern for our view-func in "urls.py" file
= url-pattern, is used by end-user(client in webpage) to send request for our views(in FirstApp-application)
= "urlpatterns" list-var routes URLs to views in our app(FirstApp)

(open urls.py file from FirstProject conf-folder)
**"urls.py" file** ***WARNING:-Dont do any un-necc-changes to file***
-----------------------------------
= goto urlpatterns list[] variable
=** For functional-views,we perform 2-steps,
a) add import-statement
Ex:-
	from FirstApp import views;
b) add our URL to urlpatterns-variable
Ex:-
url(r'^welcome/',views.display); (or) #from django.conf.urls import url; #old-style
(or)
#new-style
path('welcome/',views.display)	#from django.urls import path

=**path() is available in below module
Ex:-
	from django.urls import path


=** When End-user(client), requests url(welcome/) then display() function(from views.py of First) is executed & provides required response(HttpResponse)


Step4::-
= Re-Start the server & send the request from Browser-URL
(proj-main-folder)
cmd\FirstProject> py manage.py runserver
= "http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome"
= "http://localhost:8000/welcome"

NOTE:-
= Any changes/modify done to views.py or other files in app-folder or proj-conf-folder, they are auto.detected & DJ-live-server is "RELOADED-auto" & for new-requets from client, we get new-updated-repsonse
(everythig auto. on server)

----------------------------------------------------------------
===>> Http Request flow in Diango-Server-Application::-
(FirstApp of FirstProject)
==Diagram==
[End-User]-----Request------>[/welcome(urls.py)--->display()(views.py)]
(client)  <----Response-----(Django-Server)
 
1) Whenever End-User sends 1st-request to Django Development Server, such request is accepted by server
2) From the accepted Request django-Server identifies url-pattern using "urls.py" file, and its corresponding view will be identified in views.py
3) The request will be forwared to the view(views.py) & the corresponding function will be executed to provide response to the End-user(client)
