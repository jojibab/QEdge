==> DJango Framework Architecture::-
1) DJango Framework::-
def:-
	DJango is a Python Framework, using which we develop real-time computer Web-apps(websites)
	
(website means coll.of.webpages)
(webpage is presentation of data in the form of text/images/audio/video etc...)
Ex:-
	www.news.google.com (website)
		= India-news (webpages)
		= World-news
		= Sports-news
		...etc
		
=> Framework??
	= Framework means Pre-defined-Library + Runtime-Environment
	(Pre-defined-Library => Python modules/pkgs/classes/funcs)
	(Runtime-Environment => Django Live Development Server)
	

(**)
===> Types of Web-applications::-
= Web-applications are of 2-types,
	a) Static web-app
	b) Dynamic web-app
	
A) Static web-app::-
= This web-app data or info is common or SAME wrt 3-things,
	i) User
	ii) Time
	iii) Location
	Ex:-
		School-website
		College-website
		Hospital-website
		etc...


B) Dynamic web-app::-
= This web-app data or info is different or changing wrt 3-things,
	i) User
	ii) Time
	iii) Location
	Ex:-
		Gmail-website (user-user)
		Google-news-website (time-time)
		Google-maps-website (loc-loc)
		etc...


NOTE:-
= Using Django Framework, we develop Dynamic-web-apps


==>> Django-Architecture::-
(MVT) -> (Model-View-Template)
==Diagram==
==** Framework allows us to develop web-apps simple & easy, quick or fast with less-coding & short-time-development
= Django Framework uses MVT-approach or Architecture internally for coding-development
= MVT Stands for,
	M -> Model (Data-prog)
	V -> View (Server-prog for accept-process-response to client)
	T -> Template (html+css+javascript...etc)
	
=> This MVT-Model is as follows,
==Diagram==


NOTE:-
= Model-View-Template are different Python(.py) Files
Ex:-
	views.py
	models.py
	templates\home.html
	
=** views.py is main-file to accept-process-response to clients
(here in this file we use models & templates internally)
=** models.py comm. with Dbase using ORM tech & gets dynamic-data
(create-table,insert-rec/update-rec/del-rec all are auto-operations)
=** templates folder proviews different html-data for different-views
(/home ---> home.html)
(/aboutus ---> aboutus.html)

==** finally models+views+templates makes up ===> Django MVT Architecture

=** Hence diff-developers can work on Models/Views/Templates separately & make Web-application development Quick or Fast
(it is advantage from Django Framework)
